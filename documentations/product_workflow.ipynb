    "# AIdeator Workflow: From Problem to Product\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 1: Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initial Input Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "* User provides two inputs: target audience and problem\n",
    "* System processes these inputs to generate problem statements\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Problem Statement Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "* System generates an initial \"How might we\" problem statement (Problem Statement 1)\n",
    "* System creates an alternative problem statement by flipping core assumptions (Problem Statement 2)\n",
    "* User selects one of the two statements or requests regeneration of either\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 2: Exploration Methodologies\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Methodology Selection (by agentic AI)\n",
    "\n",
    "* User chooses one of three exploration methodologies:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1. Emotional Root Causes: Examines underlying emotional needs and motivations\n",
    "* 2. Unconventional Associations: Connects the problem to unexpected domains or analogies\n",
    "* 3. Imaginary Customers' Feedback: Explores diverse user perspectives and pain points\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Concept Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "* System generates 5-7 distinct concepts based on the selected methodology\n",
    "* Each concept includes a heading, explanation, and potential product direction\n",
    "* Concepts are organized into branches in a mindmap structure\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 3: Branch Development\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Concept Expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "* User selects branches to explore further\n",
    "* System generates sub-branches with more specific concept variations\n",
    "* User can add their own ideas to any branch\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Branch Management\n",
    "\n",
    "* User can edit, delete, or modify branches\n",
    "* System maintains hierarchical relationships between concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 4: Product Development\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Concept Combination\n",
    "\n",
    "* User selects multiple branches to combine into more complex product ideas\n",
    "* System integrates selected concepts using approaches like: Analogy Swapping; Role Reversal; Constraint Merging; Hybridization; Layering Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Product Refinement\n",
    "\n",
    "* Combined concepts are transformed into detailed product descriptions\n",
    "* Products include features lists and clear explanations\n",
    "* User can continue to edit and refine product concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 5: Market Research\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Similar Product Search\n",
    "\n",
    "* System can search for existing products similar to generated ideas\n",
    "* Searches YCombinator and ProductHunt databases (2020-2025)\n",
    "* Uses NLP relevancy matching to find the top 5 most similar companies\n",
    "* Results include company name, description, and relevance score\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Final Output\n",
    "\n",
    "* User can export final product ideas with complete feature sets\n",
    "* System can generate product roadmaps and budget analysis\n",
    "\n",
